# For a given two-dimensional integer array/list of size (N x
# M), print the array/list in a sine wave order, i.e, print the first column top to bottom, next column bottom to top and so on.
# Input format:
# The first line contains an Integer 't' which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then the test cases follow.
# First line of each test case or query contains two integer values, 'N' and 'M', separated by a single space. They represent the 'rows' and 'columns' respectively, for the two-dimensional array/list.
# Second line onwards, the next 'N' lines or rows represent the ith row values.
# Each of the ith row constitutes 'M' column values separated by a single space.
# Output format :
# For each test case, print the elements of the two-dimensional array/list in the sine wave order in a single line, separated by a single space.
# Output for every test case will be printed in a seperate line.
# Constraints :
# 1<=tï¼œ=10^2
# 0 <=N <= 10^3
# 0 <= M <= 1013
# Time Limit: 1sec
# Sample Input 1:
# 1
# 34
# 1234
# 5678
# 9 10 11 12
# Sample Output 1:
